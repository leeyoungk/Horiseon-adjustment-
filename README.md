# Horiseon-adjustment-

Deployed Application: https://leeyoungk.github.io/Horiseon-adjustment-/
## Description

This is my first homework assignment of the bootcamp. This project is refactoring an existing site to make it more accsessible without changing any functions of the webpage. Through out this project, i learned alot of helpfull experiences. As beginer , i could just start out the code with div elements and then later  I could use different semantic elements to change it situationally. Also, i learned to reorganize and improve the codebase in CSS file. 

## Installation 

First of all, i looked at the div elements and changed with more sematic elements.
Then , i looked at the classes, there are unecessary classes, i got rid of them or changed different classes name working same functions into one class name.
The images syntax did not have alt atribute so i added the alt atribute with an alternate text for the image. 
After changing the HTML file, CSS file need to be changed corrsesponding to the changes in HTML file.

## Usage
We can take a quick look at the webpage but the web application hasnt added any functions into it yet.

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
